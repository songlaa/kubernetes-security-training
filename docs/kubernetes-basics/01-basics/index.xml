Please check the official documentation to get further details.
Core concepts With the open source software Kubernetes, you get a platform to deploy your application in a container and operate it at the same time. Therefore, Kubernetes is also called a Container Platform, or the term Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) is used.
Depending on the configuration the term Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) works as well.</description></item><item><title>Deployments</title><link>/docs/kubernetes-basics/01-basics/01/_deployments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/kubernetes-basics/01-basics/01/_deployments/</guid><description>We are finally ready to get started with Kubernetes. You should have been given the setup instructions by your teacher and be logged in your namespace.
In this lab, we deploy our first container image and look at the concepts of Pods, Services, and Deployments.
Task 1.2.1: Start and stop a single Pod We have a look at deploying a pre-built container image from Quay.io or any other public container registry.</description></item><item><title>Exposing a Service</title><link>/docs/kubernetes-basics/01-basics/01/_service/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/kubernetes-basics/01-basics/01/_service/</guid><description>In this lab, we are going to make the frontend from the last lab accessible externally.
Task 1.3.1: Create a ClusterIP Service The command kubectl apply -f deployment_example-frontend.yaml from the last lab creates a Deployment but no Service.
A Kubernetes Service is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. For some parts of your application (like frontends), you may want to expose a Service to an external IP address outside your cluster.</description></item><item><title>Backend</title><link>/docs/kubernetes-basics/01-basics/01/_database/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/kubernetes-basics/01-basics/01/_database/</guid><description>Numerous applications are stateful in some way and want to save data persistently, whether in a database, as files on a filesystem, or in an object store. In this lab, we will create a MariaDB database and configure our application to store its data in it.
Task 1.4.1: Instantiate a MariaDB database We will first create a so-called Secret in which we store sensitive data. The secret will be used to access the database and also to create the initial database.</description></item></channel></rss>
