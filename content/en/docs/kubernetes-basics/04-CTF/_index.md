Capture the Flag (CTF) in computer security is an exercise in which participants attempt to find text strings, called "flags", which are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites. We will do this for Kubernetes now.

Beware all Tasks will DELETE and recreate your kind cluster. Please be sure that you have finished the other labs on your VM first.
