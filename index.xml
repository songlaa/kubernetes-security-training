All explanations and resources used in this lab give only a quick and not detailed overview. Please check the official documentation to get further details.
Core concepts With the open source software Kubernetes, you get a platform to deploy your application in a container and operate it at the same time. Therefore, Kubernetes is also called a Container Platform, or the term Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) is used.</description></item><item><title>Deploying a container image</title><link>/docs/kubernetes-basics/01-basics/01/_image/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/kubernetes-basics/01-basics/01/_image/</guid><description>We are finally ready to get started with Kubernetes. You should have been given the setup instrutions by your teacher and be logged in your own namespace.
In this lab, we are going to deploy our first container image and look at the concepts of Pods, Services, and Deployments.
Task 1.2.1: Start and stop a single Pod We are going to have a look at deploying a pre-built container image from Quay.</description></item><item><title>Exposing a service</title><link>/docs/kubernetes-basics/01-basics/01/_service/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/kubernetes-basics/01-basics/01/_service/</guid><description>In this lab, we are going to make the freshly deployed application from the last lab available online.
Task 1.3.1: Create a ClusterIP Service The command kubectl apply -f deployment_example-web-go.yaml from the last lab creates a Deployment but no Service. A kubernetes Service is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a Service to an external IP address which is outside your cluster.</description></item><item><title>Windows</title><link>/setup/local-usage/cli-installation/windows/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/setup/local-usage/cli-installation/windows/</guid><description>Installation for Windows Follow the steps outlined in https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/ .
In case the installation from the official package repositories didn&amp;rsquo;t work (or a specific version is needed) the static binary can be downloaded and put into the following path:
C:\Kubernetes\ In Windows, the PATH can be set in the advanced system settings. It depends on the version:
Windows 10 Windows 11 Note: Windows Quick Hack Copy the kubectl binary directly into the folder C:\Windows.</description></item><item><title>macOS</title><link>/setup/local-usage/cli-installation/macos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/setup/local-usage/cli-installation/macos/</guid><description>Installation for macOS Follow the steps outlined in https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/ .
In case the installation from the official package repositories didn&amp;rsquo;t work (or a specific version is needed) the static binary can be downloaded and put into the following path:
~/bin File mode The kubectl binary has to be executable:
cd ~/bin chmod +x kubectl PATH variable In macOS, the directory ~/bin should already be part of the PATH variable. In case kubectl is placed in a different directory, you can change the PATH variable with the following command:</description></item><item><title>Linux</title><link>/setup/local-usage/cli-installation/linux/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/setup/local-usage/cli-installation/linux/</guid><description>Installation for Linux Follow the steps outlined in https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/ .
